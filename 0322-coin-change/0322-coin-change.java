// #Recursive Method:#
//The idea is very classic dynamic programming: think of the last step we take. Suppose we have already found out the best way to sum up to amount a, then for the last step, we can choose any coin type which gives us a remainder r where r = a-coins[i] for all i's. For every remainder, go through exactly the same process as before until either the remainder is 0 or less than 0 (meaning not a valid solution). With this idea, the only remaining detail is to store the minimum number of coins needed to sum up to r so that we don't need to recompute it over and over again.

// Code in Java:

public class Solution {
public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    if(amount<1) return 0;
    return helper(coins, amount, new int[amount]);
}

private int helper(int[] coins, int rem, int[] count) { // rem: remaining coins after the last step; count[rem]: minimum number of coins to sum up to rem
    if(rem<0) return -1; // not valid
    if(rem==0) return 0; // completed
    if(count[rem-1] != 0) return count[rem-1]; // already computed, so reuse
    int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    for(int coin : coins) {
        int res = helper(coins, rem-coin, count);
        if(res>=0 && res < min)
            min = 1+res;
    }
    count[rem-1] = (min==Integer.MAX_VALUE) ? -1 : min;
    return count[rem-1];
}
}
